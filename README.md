# PokeAPI
Simple guessing game using a Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/) with TypeScript and React.

Inspired by https://guessthe.game/, a player will have a set number of guesses per round to figure out what the secret Pokemon is. They will be presented with limited information, with each failed guess revealing another hint about the Pokemon. If the player runs out of guesses, they lose and the Pokemon is revealed, otherwise if they guess correctly, they win!
